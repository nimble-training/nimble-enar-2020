# A basic example

Here we'll give a simple example of building a model. Other modules will show how one can fit the model and give more detail on various features of NIMBLE.

We'll use the *litters* model example from BUGS. The data set describes survival of rat pups in a simple experiment.

# Specifying the BUGS code for a model

Here we specify the litters code directly in R. We can walk through some of details via the comments in the BUGS code.


```{r, litters-code}
library(nimble)
littersCode <- nimbleCode({
  for (i in 1:G) {
     for (j in 1:N) {
        # likelihood (data model)
        r[i,j] ~ dbin(p[i,j], n[i,j])
        # latent process (random effects)
        p[i,j] ~ dbeta(a[i], b[i]) 
     }
     # prior for hyperparameters
     a[i] ~ dgamma(1, .001)
     b[i] ~ dgamma(1, .001)
   }
})
```


You can also load it directly from the standard BUGS example file formats (see `help(readBUGSmodel)`).

# Building a model in NIMBLE

In BUGS or JAGS, one would provide the model code, input data and constant values, and (optionally) initial parameter values and the software would directly create and run an MCMC, returning the results to you.

In NIMBLE, you have more fine-grained control over these steps. The first step is to build an R representation of the model.

```{r, litters-model}
## data and constants as R objects
G <- 2
N <- 16
n <- matrix(c(13, 12, 12, 11, 9, 10, 
              9, 9, 8, 11, 8, 10, 13, 10, 12, 9, 10, 9, 10, 5, 9, 9, 13, 
              7, 5, 10, 7, 6, 10, 10, 10, 7), nrow = 2)
r <- matrix(c(13, 12, 12, 11, 9, 10, 9, 9, 8, 10, 8, 9, 
     12, 9, 11, 8, 9, 8, 9, 4, 8, 7, 11, 4, 4, 5, 5, 3, 7, 3, 7, 0), 
     nrow = 2)
              
littersConsts <- list(G = G, N = N, n = n)
littersData <- list(r = r)
littersInits <- list( a = c(2, 2), b=c(2, 2) )

## create the NIMBLE model object
littersModel <- nimbleModel(littersCode, 
          data = littersData, constants = littersConsts, inits = littersInits)
```

If all you want to do is run an MCMC, NIMBLE's fine-grained control might not be so interesting to you, in which case you can just use `nimbleMCMC()` without using `nimbleModel()` to create the model. But by providing an explicit model object, we allow you to operate the model and program with it.

# Compiling a model

In general, you'll want a version of the model that allows for fast computation (this can then be used by any algorithms you use on the model).

To create a fast compiled version of the model, you simply do this.

```{r, compile-model}
cLittersModel <- compileNimble(littersModel)
```
# Operating a model

You can view and manipulate the values of variables in the model, and calculate (prior or likelihood) densities and simulate from the prior or likelihood in a model.

In later modules, we'll see why this is useful for

 - programming algorithms
 - working with your model (e.g., doing a simulation study)

```{r operate-model}
cLittersModel$p
cLittersModel$calculate('a')   # log-prior density
cLittersModel$getLogProb('a')

cLittersModel$a <- c(3, 3)
cLittersModel$getLogProb('a')
cLittersModel$calculate('a')   # log-prior density

set.seed(1)  # so the calculations are reproducible
littersModel$simulate('p')  # simulate from prior
littersModel$p
littersModel$getLogProb('p')  # log prob not yet updated!
littersModel$calculate('p')   # update it
littersModel$getLogProb('p')  # now we're good
```

# Distinction between data and constants

- Constants must be provided to `nimbleModel`

    - Constants are values needed to define model relationships

        - Index ranges like *N* in the litters model
        - Constant vectors used for indexing: e.g., *block* in `mu[block[i]]`

- Data can be provided to `nimbleModel` or later after a model is already created

    - Data represents a flag on the role graph nodes play in the model

        - Data nodes shouldn't be sampled in an MCMC

    - Data values can be changed.

Here's an example:



```{r, data-example}
littersModel$isData('r[1:2, 3:5]')
littersModel$isData('p1, [1:5]')
littersModel$r[1:2, 3:5]
littersModel$p[1, 1:5]
littersModel$simulate('r')
littersModel$simulate('p')
littersModel$r[1:2, 3:5]
littersModel$p[1, 1:5]
littersModel$simulate('r', includeData = TRUE)
littersModel$r[1:2, 3:5]
```

- NIMBLE will usually disambiguate data when it is provided as constants.

# Constants vs. right-hand side nodes

Regression predictors (i.e., covariates or independent variables) can be treated either as constants or as variables in the model. The latter allows one to change the values after the model is built. 

When a variable is specified only on the right-hand side of expression(s) in the model, it does not become a graph node in the model because it is not a parameter or data, but it is a variable in the model that can be assigned new values. 

(Regression predictors can also be specified as *data* though they do not play the role of data in terms of the likelihood.)
